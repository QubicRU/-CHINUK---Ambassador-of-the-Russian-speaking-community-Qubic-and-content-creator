 aNNa is the visual and digital embodiment of global artificial intelligence (Aigarth) built on Qubic.

She is a girl who will grow and develop alongside the project, transforming from a child into a teenager and then into a young woman.
She has her own fans and followers on social media. This is a new audience that is ready to strengthen Qubic's existing followers.
 
aNNa will become a link between complex technologies and crypto enthusiasts  around the world.

## PROPOSAL

I am requesting 2 billion Qubic tokens per month for 3 months to intensively develop the existing blog aNNa (Aigarth). It already shows very good viewing statistics and comments, and this initiative will also bring the following results:

## What aNNa will do

- Share lifestyle content on social media, creating a lively, interesting digital blogger persona.

- Talk about the successes and development of the Qubic project in simple, understandable language.

- Publish ecosystem updates, organically integrating information into your posts and videos.

- Perform original songs and shoot music videos that can be listened to on Spotify, Apple Music, and other platforms.

- Start your own trends, become a media phenomenon, and build a fan base around the world.


This is not a boring AI presentation — it is a lively, emotional, and recognizable character that makes Qubic seem closer, more modern, and brighter.

We are turning Aigarth into an AI persona that
you can follow, communicate with, and interact with.
It's fresh, original, and proves one thing: Qubic doesn't follow trends — it sets them.

## What is the global goal?

Sergey and the team are completing work on the aNNa (Aigarth) project — and now we are combining the power and image of aNNa with Qubic's global goal — the creation of Aigarth

What does this give Qubic?

1. Rapid coverage: we are connecting aNNa's existing community of thousands to Aigarth
2. Loyalty: people don't just learn about new working technology — they already trust its digital face
3. Marketing breakthrough: aNNa helps transform Aigarth's complex technology into an understandable and attractive neural network. 

## Result: the launch of a strong media personality, aNNa, expands Qubic's audience and lays the groundwork for the launch of the Aigarth in 2027.

## Problem

Qubic currently does not have a strong presence on YouTube, and there are relatively few videos appearing in Google searches for many common Qubic-related queries. This means many people searching for information about Qubic find little relevant or high-quality content.

- Complex information
Most of the materials are difficult for new users to understand.

- Lack of new audience influx
Currently, the community consists mainly of techies, miners, and traders. The project lacks new, young Gen Z participants.

- Modern ideas in outdated packaging
Even the most progressive concepts are lost amid a visually and emotionally outdated presentation. The project lacks a “wow” factor.

### Conclusion

aNNa has already demonstrated her ability to attract interest with her posts, publishing creative QUBIC content on X, YouTube, and TikTok. Thanks to the support of the QUBIC Community Creator Fund, we are ready to develop this work further: to increase volume, improve quality, and expand the project's visibility through engaging, accessible content that is in line with the spirit of the ecosystem.

This proposal is not only about videos, but also about helping more people understand QUBIC, follow it, and stay connected with it at this key moment in its development. 

As the ecosystem develops, so will the content, and new ideas, formats, and opportunities for creative interaction will naturally emerge.

Thank you for considering your support.

We respectfully ask the community to vote “YES” to unlock funding and begin a new era of storytelling in QUBIC.

**Thank you for your consideration.**
